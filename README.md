I am an IT veteran with focus on software development for web applications,
Java was my old friend but Python and I became best friends several years ago.
I recently started hanging out with Go, and Go is AWESOME.
My favorite stack is Python/FastAPI and if I have to, i'd use React for the frontend.
I enjoy working with event driven microservices, specially with DDD and CQRS.
Specially when these microservices are swimming in k8s and the infra is managed by terraform.
