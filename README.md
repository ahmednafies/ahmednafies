I am an IT veteran with focus on software development for web applications,
Java was my old friend but Python and I became best friends several years ago.
I recently started hanging out with Go, and Go is AWESOME.
My favorite stack is Python/FastAPI and if I have to, i'd use React for the frontend.
But I have also worked with Flask, Django, Sanic and Angular js (Eww I know).
I enjoy working with event driven microservices, specially with DDD and CQRS.
